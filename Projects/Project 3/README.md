# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to train your skills on
obtaining data from different sources and safely storing it in
a database. This will also help your develop skills in
designing good process workflows.

---

## Specific Objectives


* You’ll create one code to
generate structured data
from an API (or API
wrapper);
* You’ll create another code to
generate structured data
from raw web-scraping
(using beautiful-soup or
any related tool you prefer);
* You’ll design and create
your database with the
structured data obtained;
* Don’t forget to document
the process.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* The url of both of your Jupyter Notebook files on
your GitHub (the API and the raw web-scraping
codes).
* The dump of your database.
* [EXTRA] Draw the Entity-Relationship-Diagram of
your database (ERD).s
