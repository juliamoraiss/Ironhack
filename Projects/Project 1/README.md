# Project: Python Game

## Overview

The goal of this project is for you to apply the Python programming skills you have learned this week in solving a real problem. We present you the design of a classic game that can be played via text - Escape Room. Your goal is to develop the game using Python based on the game design.

Read the game narratives and technical requirements carefully. Plan how you will achieve your goal with pseudo codes and/or flowchart. Review the logic and process in order to avoid potential errors. Then implement with Python code. After that, test your code several times with different inputs and make sure it's rock solid. The instructional team is standing by to help you in case you run into any problems.

## Technical Requirements

* Use Python lists and dictionaries to define the rooms, items, and relations of them.

* Use a Python dictionary to store the game state. Update the state dictionary when progresses are made such as a key is collected.

* Use Python functions to play the game. Don't use procedural code.

* After completing each game action, call the next function to continue playing until the winning condition is reached.

* The winning condition is for the player to successfully make to the "Outside" room. When this happens, congrat the player and end the game.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo.

* `main.ipynb` that contains your solution.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

1. Start Jupyter Notebook from this lab directory.

1. Launch `sample-code.ipynb` and read through the file. Also execute the code and play the game. Make sure you understand what each line of the codes does.

1. Create `main.ipynb` and copy the codes from `sample-code.ipynb`. Expand the code following the example to create Bedroom 1.

1. Test the game with Game Room and Bedroom 1. Make sure everything works then work on Bedroom 2 then Living Room.

1. Test the whole game. Try to make all kinds of inputs to make sure your game is rock solid and will not break.
